## Hi there 👋

I received a B.S. degree in Software and Computer Engineering from Ajou University in Suwon, South Korea in August 2023. I am a M.S. student in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University. I am a member of the [WISE (Web Infrastructure and Software Enhancement) Lab](https://wise.ajou.ac.kr), led by Ph.D. Sangyoon Oh. My research interests include web system design, distributed systems, and application security. You can contact me via email at unidev@ajou.ac.kr.
